# thumbnail-classification
This repository contains python scripts for classification of colorectal cancer datasets consisting of histopathological images such as whole tissue resections containing tumor or only healthy tissue, biopsies, lymph node resections, IHCs etc. Simple low-res thumbnails are used as inputs for a CNN classifier based on a Resnet-18 in order to reduce computation time while remaining highly accurate. Our workflows are described in the following paper:

The models used in our paper were trained on data from the FOXTROT trial containing the following classes of tissue: tumor resection, healthy tissue, lymph node, biopsy, fat, IHC & TMA. These models were shown to produce accurate classification results on multiple external cohorts.
