# thumbnail-classification
This repository contains python scripts for classification of colorectal cancer datasets consisting of histopathological images such as whole tissue resections containing tumor or only healthy tissue, biopsies, lymph node resections, IHCs etc. Simple low-res thumbnails are used as inputs for a CNN classifier based on a Resnet-50 in order to reduce computation time while remaining highly accurate.
